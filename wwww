# Cấp quyền thực thi cho file Chrome
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/chrome-linux64/chrome 

# Tạo symbolic link để dễ gọi
sudo ln -s /usr/local/bin/chrome-linux64/chrome /usr/bin/google-chrome



# 1. Kiểm tra xem link hiện tại đang trỏ đi đâu (nếu có)
readlink /usr/bin/google-chrome

# 2. Xóa symbolic link cũ (Chỉ khi bạn biết chắc đó là link cũ)
sudo rm /usr/bin/google-chrome

# 3. Tạo lại symbolic link (Trỏ đến file thực thi 'chrome' bên trong thư mục)
# Đảm bảo file thực thi Chrome của bạn nằm ở: /usr/local/bin/chrome-linux64/chrome
sudo ln -s /usr/local/bin/chrome-linux64/chrome /usr/bin/google-chrome

# 4. Kiểm tra lại việc tạo link đã thành công chưa
/usr/bin/google-chrome --version
